## Note: This project is incomplete 
	A friend once said, ‘You can write a calculator in a day, but perfecting it can take a lifetime.’

## Project Overview
	Built with Clean Architecture

# Usage
 I used the (.) in the connection string. If you have a DB server locally or on a WAN, you need to edit the connection string.
This app is built to use with SQL Server. If you have another DB, you need to change some configurations in ConfigureServices class in the Infrastructure project.
## To run this app, you should migrate first, then update the DB:
    add-migration "example"
    update-database 
    **don't forget to choose default project in console as Employee.Infrastructure**

  Don’t forget to set the Employee.Manager as the startup project!!!.
